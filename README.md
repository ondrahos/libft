## libft Project Summary

### Project Overview

The libft project at 42 School is an essential stepping stone for mastering programming fundamentals in C. It requires students to create their own library of functions, covering basic functionalities that are commonly used in C programming and beyond.

### Key Objectives

- Implement a variety of functions for tasks such as string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management.
- Develop a deep understanding of standard library functions by recreating them from scratch.
- Utilize efficient coding practices, adhere to the Norm (42's coding style guide), and ensure code readability and maintainability.

### Core Features

1. **String Manipulation:**
   - Functions to manipulate strings, including `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strncpy`, `ft_strcat`, `ft_strncat`, `ft_strcmp`, `ft_strncmp`, etc.

2. **Memory Management:**
   - Memory allocation functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_bzero`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memccpy`, `ft_memmove`, `ft_memchr`, `ft_memcmp`, `ft_memalloc`, `ft_memdel`, etc.

3. **Linked Lists:**
   - Implementation of basic linked list operations, such as `ft_lstnew`, `ft_lstadd_front`, `ft_lstsize`, `ft_lstlast`, `ft_lstadd_back`, `ft_lstdelone`, `ft_lstclear`, `ft_lstiter`, `ft_lstmap`, etc.

4. **Character Operations:**
   - Functions for character operations like `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, `ft_isascii`, `ft_isprint`, `ft_toupper`, `ft_tolower`, etc.

5. **Additional Utilities:**
   - Additional utility functions such as `ft_atoi`, `ft_itoa`, `ft_calloc`, `ft_strdup`, etc.

### Benefits

- Enhances understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
- Reinforces proficiency in C programming language.
- Builds a foundation for tackling more complex programming challenges.

### Conclusion

The libft project is not just about creating a library of functions; it's about gaining a deeper understanding of programming concepts and developing the skills necessary to become a proficient programmer. Through this project, students lay the groundwork for their journey towards becoming adept software engineers.
